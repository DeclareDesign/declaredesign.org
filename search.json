    "section": "",
    "text": "In designs in which a treatment is assigned in clusters (e.g. classrooms), it’s usual practice to account for cluster-level correlations when you generate estimates of uncertainty about estimated effects. But units often share commonalities at higher levels, such as at a block level (e.g. schools). Sometimes you need to take account of this and sometimes you don’t. We show an instance of the usual procedure of clustering by assignment cluster (classrooms) working well and show how badly you can do with a more conservative approach (clustering by schools). We then show an example of a design in which clustering at the level of treatment assignment (classroom) is not good enough; in the troublesome example, schools are thought of as being sampled from a larger population of schools and treatment effects are different in different schools. In this case, if you want estimates of uncertainty for population level effects you have to cluster at the school level even though treatment is assigned within schools.\nDavid McKenzie discussed this issue a while ago here following discussions by Chris Blattman here. While broadly in line with these discussions, our take-away leans a bit more in the direction that yes you really might want to cluster at higher levels than treatment assignment in an experiment in some cases, but only when you are targeting non-sample-based estimands such as population average effects.\nMore generally, the post shows how to check for these kinds of issues when you declare a design, exploiting the fact that with a design declared you can compare the distribution of estimates of standard errors with the standard deviation of the estimates you get across many runs. So you can see not just whether estimates of uncertainty are unbiased, but also whether they are precise."

    "text": "Deaton and Cartwright (2017) provide multiple arguments against claims that randomized trials should be thought of as a kind of gold standard of scientific evidence. One striking argument they make is that randomization does not justify the statistical tests that researchers typically use. They are right in that. Even if researchers can claim that their estimates of uncertainty are justified by randomization, their habitual use of those estimates to conduct t-tests are not. To get a handle on how severe the problem is we replicate the results in Deaton and Cartwright (2017) and then use a wider set of diagnosands to probe more deeply. Our investigation suggests that what at first seems like a big problem might not in fact be so great if your hypotheses are what they often are for experimentalists—sharp and sample-focused.\nMore specifically, Deaton and Cartwright (2017) argue that that “spurious significance […] arises when the distribution of treatment effects contains outliers or, more generally, is not symmetric.” They back up the claim with simulation results from a case with heterogeneous asymmetrically distributed treatment effects that center on 0. In fact however, both the sharp null of no effect and the null of no average effect in a given sample are false in this example and so the worry about over-rejecting does not apply to these hypotheses.\nA bit more generally, under the sharp null of no effect the distribution of treatment effects in simple trials (with 50% assignment probabilities) will be perfectly symmetrical even if the distribution of potential outcomes is arbitrarily skewed and so the concern Deaton and Cartwright (2017) point to doesn’t arise in the first place.\nThe most important take away though might be that it’s hard to think through when the use of t-tests is or is not appropriate. But design diagnosis can tip you off to whether this likely a problem in your case."

This clarifies that the skew-based concern about over-rejecting a null that Deaton and Cartwright raise actually depends on the sharp null being false in the first place.

Say \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned to just four units. Whenever \\(Z\\) is assigned to four units with the same value on \\(Y\\), a t-test will suggest a significant difference (\\(p = 0.04\\)). You can interpret that as a claim that such a data pattern should only be observed 4% of the time if the null is true. But you can figure out pretty quickly that you will see data patterns like this about one eighth of the time.2 So the probability of observing such data under the null is actually much higher than the 4% you might infer from the \\(t\\)-test.\nSo in general there can be dangers using t-tests even with experimental data. A solution in this instance, if we are interested in a sharp null of no effect, is to do randomization inference. This would produce exactly the right p-value.

To alert yourself to the problem, you could routinely diagnose a design with zero effects (a “null design”) and so set yourself up to get a tip off when your power is too high."

    "text": "Data collection is expensive, and we often only get one bite at the apple. In response, we often conduct an inexpensive (and small) pilot test to help better design the study. Pilot studies have many virtues, including practicing the logistics of data collection and improving measurement tools. But using pilots to get noisy estimates in order to determine sample sizes for scale up comes with risks.\nPilot studies are often used to get a guess of the average effect size, which is then plugged into power calculators when designing the full study.\nThe procedure is:\nWe show in this post that this procedure turns out to be dangerous: at common true effect sizes found in the social sciences, you are at risk of selecting an underpowered design based on the noisy effect estimate in your pilot study. For a related argument about the dangers of post-hoc power analysis, which inspired this post, see Andy Gelman’s blog.\nA different procedure has better properties:\nWe show what happens in each procedure, using DeclareDesign. In each case, we’ll think about a decision the researcher wants to make based on the pilot: should I move forward with my planned study, or should I go back to the drawing board? We’ll rely on power to make that decision in the first procedure and the MDE in the second procedure.\nTo get started, we set up a designer1 for a standard two-arm trial where half of units are assigned to treatment and we use a difference-in-means estimator. We will use the same designer to simulate the pilot (N = 50) and the main study (N = 500).

    "title": "Common estimators of uncertainty overestimate uncertainty",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Random assignment provides a justification not just for estimates of effects but also for estimates of uncertainty about effects. The basic approach, due to Neyman, is to estimate the variance in estimates of the difference between outcomes in treatment and in control outcomes using the variability that can be observed among units in control and units in treatment. It’s an ingenious approach and dispenses with the need to make any assumptions about the shape of statistical distributions or about asymptotics. The problem though is that it can sometimes be upwardly biased, meaning that it might lead you to maintain null hypotheses when you should be rejecting them. We use design diagnosis to get a handle on how great this problem is and how it matters for different estimands.\nThe key insight is that how great a problem this is depends on the target of inference. If you are targeting a sample average treatment effect (SATE), your standard errors will often be too big. If you are targeting a population average treatment effect (PATE), but that population is itself sampled from a superpopulation, your standard errors may also be too big, though the issues are less severe. If you’re targeting a superpopulation average treatment effect (SPATE), your standard errors will be the right size.\nA quick word on what we’re not talking about. Under complete random assignment (exactly \\(m\\) of \\(N\\) units in the sample are treated), the difference-in-means estimator of the average treatment effect is of course unbiased, which means that it returns exactly the right answer, on average. The bias we are talking about here isn’t in the estimator of the treatment effect, but instead, it’s in the standard error estimator.\nWe want to estimate \\(\\text{sd}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_T}\\sum_{i \\in T} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{n_C}\\sum_{i \\in C} Y_i(0) \\right)\\). The usual estimator for this is the Neyman standard error. This estimator uses the fact that the variance of a difference (treatment - control) can be expressed in terms of the variance of each group (variance of treatment outcomes, variance of control outcomes), and the covariance between them (see Freedman). We can estimate the variances easily enough but unfortunately we cannot estimate the covariance because we never simultaneously see outcomes for treatment and control for a given unit. Instead the Neyman estimator assumes the worst and estimates an upper bound on the variance. This is equivalent to HC2 robust standard errors in a regression setup and it is what is estimated by default in estimatr::difference_in_means and estimatr::lm_robust.\nFrom some perspectives, a conservative standard error estimator is better than the alternative. With a conservative estimator, we are less certain of our ATE estimates than we should be. If you’re conducting hypothesis tests, upward bias in the standard errors means you’re less likely to commit a Type I error (inappropriately rejecting the null) but you’re more likely to commit a Type II error (inappropriately failing to reject). So how bad this is depends on how you trade off these errors.\nWe’re going to investigate this question at three levels that correspond to three estimands. The highest level is the superpopulation, and the associated estimand is the superpopulation average treatment effect (SPATE). The next highest is the population, whose estimand is the population average treatment effect (PATE). The lowest level is the sample, with an associated estimand called the sample average treatment effect (SATE). Depending on how units are sampled into the population or the sample, these three estimands could have different values.\nWe’re interested in:\nWe can learn about all of these using a simulation conducted in DeclareDesign. The design includes the parameters r (the correlation between Y0 and Y1) and b (the superpopulation average treatment effect) in case you’d like to vary them, but we’ve set them to zero for this demonstration. Note that setting r=0 means that potential outcomes under treatment and control are not correlated. This implies heterogeneous effects: if effects were homogeneous then these outcomes would be perfectly correlated (for intuition, imagine a graph of \\(Y(1)\\) against \\(Y(0)\\)).\nr &lt;- 0 # correlation between Y0 and Y1\nb &lt;- 0 # average treatment effect\n\ndesign &lt;- \n  declare_model(N = 64,\n                u_0 = rnorm(N),\n                u_1 = rnorm(n = N, mean = r * u_0, sd = sqrt(1 - r^2)),\n                Y_Z_0 = u_0, \n                Y_Z_1 = u_1 + b) +\n  declare_sampling(S = complete_rs(N, n = 32)) +\n  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) +\n  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z)"

    "title": "What does a p-value tell you about the probability a hypothesis is true?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The humble \\(p\\)-value is much maligned and terribly misunderstood. The problem is that everyone wants to know the answer to the question: “what is the probability that [hypothesis] is true?” But \\(p\\) answers a different (and not terribly useful) question: “how (un)surprising is this evidence given [hypothesis]?” Can \\(p\\) shed insight on the question we really care about? Maybe, though there are dangers.\nThis post is inspired by conversations with @david_colquhoun who has been doing a lot of work on the misinterpretation of p-values (see especially “The false positive risk: a proposal concerning what to do about p values”). David poses the question “what is the probability that the null hypothesis is true given the observed \\(p\\)-value?” and provides a nice approach to answering this in terms of a “false positive risk.” The approach we present here is similar in spirit though based on a simulation approach given defined priors rather than being based on likelihood ratios.1\nThe key insight is that there is something to the intuition that if the world doesn’t look how it ought to look if indeed some hypothesis is right, then maybe that hypothesis isn’t right. Formally the connection comes via Bayes rule; the \\(p\\)-value (or, likelihood) plays a big role in Bayes’ formula for calculating the quantity of interest: posterior beliefs in hypotheses, given data.2 To use the rule though you need information on prior beliefs. Unfortunately, since “frequentist” statistics make no use of prior beliefs many researchers generally don’t report priors (indeed since frequentists and Bayesians think about probabilities differently, some will balk at the idea).\nBut what if you did have access to priors? With priors, you can construct Bayesian inferences from the diagnosis of a frequentist design. If we encode our priors into the population declaration then we can map from \\(p\\) to posteriors and let \\(p\\) answer the question we keep on wanting it to answer.\nHere is an illustration. Unlike most other designs we have looked at, in this design the estimand has a distribution. For simplicity we consider a design with a binary outcome; the estimand is the average treatment effect (or in epidemiology the “absolute risk increase”). The distribution for b in our model of the world reflects our beliefs about the estimand: we assume that it is distributed uniform over 0 and 1.3\nN &lt;- 50\ndesign &lt;- \n  declare_model(N = N, b = runif(1, min = 0, max = 1), u = runif(N, min = 0, max = 1),\n                potential_outcomes(Y ~ (u &lt; b)*Z + (u &gt; (1 + b)/2))) +\n  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) +\n  declare_inquiry(ATE = b[1]) +\n  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z)\nWhen we simulate this design, each run takes a different estimand (b) from the uniform distribution, generates data and calculates effects and \\(p\\)-values.\nsimulations &lt;- simulate_design(design)\nNow if we graph the estimand from each run against the \\(p\\)-values from each run we can see the distribution of estimands conditional on the \\(p\\)-value. We can now think of each vertical slice of this graph as displaying the posterior distribution of estimands given \\(p\\).\nsimulations %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = estimand, x = p.value)) +\n    geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.1) +\n    stat_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n    scale_x_continuous(trans='sqrt', breaks = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1)) +\n    xlab(\"p.value (square root scale to clearly distinguish small values)\")\nWe see from the graph that a Bayesian who has access to the study design and who learns only about the \\(p\\)-value from a study should update sharply about the size of the treatment effect.4 If they see a very low \\(p\\) they should infer that the effect is large. Conversely, if they see a high \\(p\\) they should infer that the effect is probably quite small: in other words, they do infer, contrary to frequentist wisdom, that absence of evidence is evidence of absence."

    "title": "Improve power using your answer strategy, not just your data strategy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Most power calculators take a small number of inputs: sample size, effect size, and variance. Some also allow for number of blocks or cluster size as well as the overall sample size. All of these inputs relate to your data strategy. Unless you can control the effect size and the noise, you are left with sample size and data structure (blocks and clusters) as the only levers to play with to try to improve your power.\nIn fact, though, power depends on your answer strategy and not just your data strategy and so you might do better putting resources into improving what you do with your data rather than the amount of data you have.\n\nPower from the answer strategy\nRandom assignment generally means that you do not have to include control variables in an analysis in order to achieve unbiasedness. But including controls can improve precision and increase power. If you are trying to improve your power but adding observations is expensive, perhaps you should first explore whether you can improve power by adjusting the estimation approach.\nHere is an illustration of a two-arm trial with 40 units in which 20 units are assigned to treatment, blocking on a binary pre-treatment covariate \\(W\\). We’ll let the treatment effects vary according to \\(W\\), but the true average treatment effect (our estimand in this case) is equal to 1.\n\nN = 40\n\n# Model\nmodel &lt;- declare_model(N, W = rep(0:1, N / 2), u = rnorm(N), potential_outcomes(Y ~ 2 * Z * W + u))  \n\n# Inquiry\ninquiry     &lt;- declare_inquiry(ate = 1)  \n\n# Data strategy\nassignment   &lt;- declare_assignment(Z = block_ra(blocks = W))\nmeasurement  &lt;- declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z))\n\n# Answer strategy\nestimator  &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, estimand = \"ate\", label = \"Simple D-I-M\")\n\n# Declare the design\ndesign &lt;- model + inquiry + assignment + measurement + estimator\n\nUnder this data generating process, the treatment interacts quite strongly with \\(W\\). The average effect of treatment is 1, but the conditional average treatment effects are 0 and 2 for the two levels of \\(W\\). The difference-in-means analysis strategy for this design is equivalent to an OLS regression of the outcome on the treatment with no control variables included. Because of random assignment, this procedure is of course unbiased, but it leaves money on the table in the sense that we could achieve higher statistical power if we included information about \\(W\\) in some way. Here is the power of the difference-in-means answer strategy:\n\ndiagnose_design(design)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\nN Sims\n\n\n\n\nate\n0.32\n0.75\n0.98\n1.00\n0.32\n0.39\n0.00\n1.00\n10000\n\n\n\n\n\nSo power is good though short of conventional standards. Based on this diagnosis the probability of getting a statistically significant result is only 0.75 even though the true effect is reasonably large.\nLet’s consider two additional estimation strategies. The first controls for the pre-treatment covariate \\(W\\) in an OLS regression of the outcome on treatment plus the covariate. This strategy is the standard approach to the inclusion of covariates in experimental analysis. An alternative is the “Lin estimator,” so named by us because of the lovely description of this approach given in Lin (2013). This estimator interacts treatment with the de-meaned covariates. The lm_lin() function in the estimatr package implements the Lin estimator for easy use.\nHere is the expanded design and the diagnosis:\n\nnew_design &lt;- design +\n              declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + W,  model = lm_robust,\n                                inquiry = \"ate\", label = \"OLS: Control for W\") +\n              declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, covariates = ~ W, model = lm_lin,\n                                inquiry = \"ate\", label = \"Lin: Control + Interaction\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimator\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\nN Sims\n\n\n\n\nLin: Control + Interaction\n0.00\n0.32\n0.87\n0.95\n1.00\n0.32\n0.31\n0.00\n1.00\n10000\n\n\nOLS: Control for W\n0.00\n0.32\n0.81\n0.97\n1.00\n0.32\n0.35\n0.00\n1.00\n10000\n\n\nSimple D-I-M\n0.00\n0.32\n0.74\n0.99\n1.00\n0.32\n0.39\n0.00\n1.00\n10000\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see here a clear ranking of the three estimation strategies in terms of power. You will notice that the coverage also varies across designs: the simple difference in means approach is actually overly conservative in part because it does not take account of the blocked randomization. The OLS model that in some sense “controls for blocks” does better, but is still above the nominal coverage of 95%. In this case, the coverage of the Lin model is excellent.\n\n\nTradeoffs\nTo figure out how these gains in power from switching up estimation strategies compare with gains from increasing \\(N\\) we declare a sequence of designs, differing only in values for \\(N\\). We do that in two steps:\n\ndesigns   &lt;- redesign(new_design, N = seq(30, 80, 10))\ndiagnoses &lt;- diagnose_design(designs)\n\nThe diagnoses object now contains full diagnoses for a whole sequence of designs that assume different \\(N\\)s and that each contain multiple estimation strategies. Here is a graph of the output showing trade-offs between design size and estimation strategy.\n\ndiagnoses$diagnosands_df %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(N, power)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = estimator))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see here that if you had 45 units and wanted to use simple differences in means your power would be around 80%. You could up your power to just over 90% by increasing the size of the experiment to about 60 units. Or, conditional on speculations about the heterogeneous effects of treatment, you could do the same thing by staying at 45 but switching over to the Lin estimator.\n\n\nA puzzle\nSometimes researchers coarsen control variables, for example turning a 10 point democracy scale into a binary variable, because they believe the finer scale is noisier. Can you declare a design to assess whether dichotomizing an outcome variable increases or decreases power?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLin, Winston. 2013. “Agnostic Notes on Regression Adjustments to Experimental Data: Reexamining Freedman’s Critique.” The Annals of Applied Statistics 7 (1): 295–318."

    "text": "Consider an observational study looking at the effect of a non-randomly assigned treatment, \\(Z\\), on an outcome \\(Y\\). Say you have a pretreatment covariate, \\(X\\), that is correlated with both \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\). Should you control for \\(X\\) when you try to assess the effect of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\)?\nThis has been a question of some disagreement, with Rosenbaum (2002), for instance, arguing that “there is little to no reason to avoid adjustment for a true covariate, a variable describing subjects before treatment,” and Greenland, Pearl, and Robins (1999) and others arguing that you cannot answer this question without a causal model of how \\(Z\\) relates to \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). See also this discussion hosted by Andy Gelman. Controlling for pretreatment covariates in a randomized experiment usually can’t hurt and usually increases precision – but what about in an observational study in which pretreatment covariates might be correlated with both the (nonrandomly assigned) treatment and the outcome?\nDesign declaration and diagnosis makes it relatively simple to examine the kinds of cases that worry Greenland et al and see where risks of bias might come from.\nLet’s declare a design with a model of the form:\nIn this world, \\(X\\) is a function of background unobserved variables \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\), a treatment variable \\(Z\\) is a function of \\(U_2\\), and an outcome \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(Z\\) and \\(U_1\\). We can assume that that \\(X\\) is determined prior to \\(Z\\). We will use two answer strategies, both regression based approaches, one with a control and one without.1 Here is the full declaration:\n# Parameters\nb &lt;- 1\nN &lt;- 40\n\n# Declaration\nmodel &lt;- declare_model(N = N, U_1 = rnorm(N), U_2 = rnorm(N),\n                       X = U_1 + U_2, Z  = 1 * (U_2 &gt; 0),\n                       potential_outcomes(Y ~ b * Z + U_1))\ninquiry     &lt;- declare_inquiry(ate = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0))\nmeasurement &lt;- declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z))\nanswer_1    &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, inquiry = \"ate\",\n                                 model = lm_robust, label = \"No control\")\nanswer_2    &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + X, inquiry = \"ate\",\n                                 model = lm_robust, label = \"With control\")\n\ndesign &lt;- model + inquiry + measurement + answer_1 + answer_2\nHere is the diagnosis:\ndiagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(design)\nDesign\nInquiry\nEstimator\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\n\n\n\n\ndesign\nate\nNo control\n-0.00\n0.31\n0.86\n0.95\n1.00\n0.31\n0.32\n0.00\n1.00\n\n\ndesign\nate\nWith control\n-1.17\n1.18\n0.14\n0.00\n-0.17\n0.17\n0.17\n0.98\n1.00\nWe see that the estimator without controls is unbiased while the one with controls is very biased. Clearly, introducing a control was a mistake, even though the control was pretreatment.\nThe reason why the estimator without controls is unbiased is simple enough: \\(U_2\\) is correlated with \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (via \\(Z\\)), however it is not correlated with \\(Y\\) given \\(Z\\). Indeed, in the model given, it is as if \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned by \\(U_2\\).\nThe reason why the estimator with controls behaves so poorly is not as obvious. Conditioning on \\(X\\) introduces a correlation between \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) that is not due to the effect of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\). In the language used by researchers working with graphical causal models, \\(X\\) is a “collider” for \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\). Conditioning on \\(X\\) creates a “backdoor path” between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\), inducing a correlation between them that is not a result of the causal effect.\nFor a little more intuition, we can modify the design to look at a world in which \\(Z\\) does not affect \\(Y\\):\nnull_design &lt;- redesign(design, N = 5000, b = 0)\nDiagnosis yields:\nestimator\nbias\n\n\n\n\nNo control\n0.00\n\n\nWith control\n-1.17\nWe still observe bias. To see where this bias is coming from, let us draw data from this design and plot the relationship between \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\). Doing so lets us see how \\(Z\\) and \\(Y\\) relate to to each other for different values of \\(X\\).\ndraw_data(null_design) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(X, Y, color = as.factor(Z))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = seq(-4, 4, 2)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\nNote: Correlation between Z and Y introduced by controlling for X.\nWhat we see here is that, overall, the red points are no higher or lower than the blue points — indicating no treatment effect. Yet within any vertical band (i.e., keeping \\(X\\) fixed), the blue dots are generally higher than the red dots. Conditioning induces a non-causal correlation.\nThe implication is quite a deep one: models of data generating processes are sometimes required in order to justify the choice of statistical models."

In each case a complete design usually requires specifying a model of how the world works, inquiries (estimands), data strategies (sampling and assignment) and answer strategies (estimates) (see here for more detail).\nEach designer in the library can make a class of designs based on the arguments you provide. The library includes simple experimental designers, as well as designers for factorial and multiarm experiments. It also has designers for observational studies, such as regression discontinuity designs or instrumental variables designs. And it even has some designers for simple qualitative studies, such as process tracing.\nSuppose for instance you were interested in a 2-by-2 factorial design. The “Two by Two” designer in the library lets you specify the sample size, mean outcomes and standard deviations in each outcome cell, and the assignment probability for each factor (prob A, prob B). You can also specify how your estimand weights the effects across arms (weight A, weight B). Other designers allow different arguments; in the multiarm designer for example you can specify the number of arms you have and then provide arguments related to each arm. (Click the Read more button for details on each designer).\nOnce you plug in the values you want, the interface generates the code for the design and you can start putting it to work.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The ‘Design’ tab.

We have been working on developing the DeclareDesign family of software packages to let researchers easily generate research designs and assess their properties. Our plan over the next six months is to put up weekly blog posts showing off features of the packages or highlighting the kinds of things you can learn about research design using this approach.\nOur very first blog post is not here but over at the World Bank Development Impact blog. Big thanks to Berk Özler and colleagues for hosting us there and helping us to spread the word. The Development Impact post introduces the ideas behind design declaration and diagnosis.\nOur first post here will use DeclareDesign to shed light on what has been a point of disagreement between researchers trying to figure out whether there are ever risks of bias arising from taking account of control variables – even “pretreatment” variables – when assessing effects in observational research."

    "text": "In many experiments, random assignment is performed at the level of clusters. Researchers are conscious that in such cases they cannot rely on the usual standard errors and they should take account of this feature by clustering their standard errors. Another, more subtle, risk in such designs is that if clusters are of different sizes, clustering can actually introduce bias, even if all clusters are assigned to treatment with the same probability. Luckily, there is a relatively simple fix that you can implement at the design stage.\nFor intuition, imagine two clusters, one of size 1,000,000 and the other of size 1. Say that outcomes are 0 in both clusters in the control condition, but that in the treatment condition they are 0 in the big cluster and 1 in the small one. Then the average treatment effect is about 0 (really: 1/1,000,000). But depending on which cluster is assigned to treatment one will (using difference-in-means) estimate either 0 or 1. So the expected estimate is 0.5. Far from the truth.\nThe Horvitz-Thompson estimator is an alternative to difference-in-means and does not have this problem. Using Horvitz-Thompson, one would estimate either \\(\\frac{1}{10^6}\\left(\\frac{1}{0.5} - \\frac{0}{0.5}\\right)\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{10^6}\\left(\\frac{0}{0.5} - \\frac{0}{0.5}\\right)\\) and so get it right in expectation. In practice however, researchers often avoid Horvitz-Thompson since it can produce estimates outside of the ranges of the data and can exhibit high variance.\nThe design-based fix for this problem is given in Imai et al. (2009). As they show, the problem can be greatly alleviated by blocking on cluster size. We will use a simple design declaration to show the problem and how blocking helps.\n\nA design with heterogeneous cluster sizes\nLet’s declare a design with heterogeneous cluster sizes. There are 300 units in 12 clusters. Two bigger clusters are of size 100 and 10 smaller clusters are of size 10. The 200 units in clusters of size 100 have a 0 treatment effect, the other 100 in clusters of size 10 have an effect of 3. This means that the average treatment effect is 1. Note that we did not include any cluster level “shocks” though we did include heterogeneous effects by cluster.\nHere is the design:\n\nN_clusters &lt;- 12\n\ncluster_design &lt;- \n  # M: Model\n  declare_model(clusters = add_level(N = N_clusters, \n                                          cl_size = rep(c(100, 10), c(N/6, N - N/6)),\n                                          effect = ifelse(cl_size == 100, 0, 3)),\n                     units    = add_level(N = cl_size, u = rnorm(N, sd = .2),\n                                          Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = u + effect)) +\n  \n  # I: Inquiry\n  declare_inquiry(ATE_i = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) +\n\n  # D: Data Strategy\n  declare_assignment(Z = cluster_ra(clusters = clusters)) +\n  \n  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n\n  # A: Answer Strategy\n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, inquiry = \"ATE_i\", clusters = clusters,\n                    model = lm_robust, label = \"dim\") +\n  \n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, inquiry = \"ATE_i\", clusters = clusters,\n                    condition_prs = 0.5, simple = FALSE,\n                    model = horvitz_thompson, label = \"ht\")\n\nIn the plot below we show the distribution of possible estimates from different possible random assignments. The true treatment effect is 1. We see bias (of size 0.327) from the fact that the distribution is clearly not centered at 1. Very large effects (approx. 3) are estimated in those cases where both of the large clusters get assigned to control (and so all treated outcomes are around 3, right mode) whereas the estimated effects (approx. 0) when both are assigned to treatment are not so small in comparison (left mode), producing right skew. The HT estimator, in contrast, does fine on bias in this example and also has a tighter distribution.\n\nsimulate_design(cluster_design) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(estimate)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  facet_wrap( ~ estimator)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale matters\nThe problem in this design, we saw, arises when all the large units get assigned to the control condition. This unlucky combination is a higher probability event in small studies than it is in large studies. In larger studies we are more likely to see balance in the allocation of units to treatment and control. To illustrate, we scale up to 120 clusters rather than 12. We see a more continuous distribution of treatment effects and in a particular a shift away from the extremes of the distribution, which arise only when like types end up in like conditions.\n\nsimulate_design(redesign(cluster_design, N_clusters = 120)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(estimate)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ estimator)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the bias is of size 0.027, which is a big reduction.\n\n\nBlock on cluster size to address this risk\nHow can we address the bias in the difference-in-means estimator? As described in Imai et al. (2009), blocking our treatment assignment such that a similar number of large clusters are assigned to treatment and control, and a similar number of small clusters are assigned to treatment and control, can help a lot.\nTo see this, we can transform this cluster design into a blocked cluster design by changing the assignment strategy; here using one in which we pair off the clusters based on size and randomly assign one in each pair to treatment.\n\nmatched_cluster_design &lt;- replace_step(\n  cluster_design, step = 3, declare_assignment(Z = block_and_cluster_ra(clusters = clusters, blocks = cl_size)))\n\nThe sampling distribution of the difference-in-means estimators is tight—variation reflects only the random differences between clusters and not the systematic differences. It is, moreover, now equivalent to the HT distribution since there is essentially no differential weighting within blocks.\n\nsimulate_design(matched_cluster_design) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(estimate)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ estimator)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension: The problem is aggravated by sampling (but there is a solution in that case also!)\nThis problem is amplified when clusters are sampled from a larger population of clusters with equal probability. In this case both the difference-in-means and the Horvitz Thompson estimators will be biased. The intuition is similar to the problem with random assignment: tiny clusters are equally likely to be sampled as very large clusters, and the inclusion of some tiny clusters biases down both estimators when outcomes are a function of cluster size. This bias will exist even when randomization is blocked on cluster size. One intuitive possibility to address this bias is to change the probability of sampling to oversample large clusters and undersample small clusters – probability-proportional-to-size sampling. Higgins (2014) proposes such a design. Intuitively, this helps because those tiny clusters that lead to bias are less likely to be selected. Higgins (2014) demonstrates that the Hansen and Hurwitz (1943) estimator is unbiased in this setting.\nWhile we don’t declare this alternative design in this post we will sign off with a step declaration for the HH estimator which could be useful for addressing this problem in the future.\n\n# A step!\nhansen_hurwitz &lt;- function(data){\n  data %&gt;% group_by(clusters) %&gt;% \n      summarize(is_treated = first(Z), cluster_mean = 1/n() * sum(Y)) %&gt;% \n      ungroup %&gt;% \n      summarize(estimate = sum(1/sum(is_treated) * cluster_mean[is_treated]) -\n                           sum(1/sum(!is_treated) * cluster_mean[!is_treated])) %&gt;% \n      as.data.frame\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHansen, Morris H., and William N.

    "text": "Mostly we use design diagnostics to assess issues that arise because of design decisions. But you can also use these tools to examine issues that arise after implementation. Here we look at risks from publication bias and illustrate two distinct types of upwards bias that arise from a “significance filter.” A journal for publishing null results might help, but the results in there are also likely to be biased, downwards.\nTwo distinct problems arise if only significant results are published:\n\nThe results of published studies will be biased towards larger magnitudes.\nThe published studies will be unrepresentative of the distribution of true effects in the relevant population of studies.\n\nThese two problems are quite distinct. The first problem is more familiar: conditional on any true effect size, larger estimates have an easier time passing the statistical significance filter, so the distribution of published results will be biased upwards because it will be missing all of the smaller estimates. The second problem is more subtle. If different studies seek to measure effects that are of different size, conditioning on statistical significance means that we are more likely to learn from places that have large effects than from places that have small effects. The significance filter means that our answers to any particular question will be biased and it means that the set of questions we see answers to will be biased as well. The Journal of Significant Results is a poor guide to the true distribution of causal effects.\nWhat about a Journal of Null Results? Such a journal would condition acceptance on failing to achieve statistical significance. The set of articles published in such a journal would also be biased. We’ll explore this idea with a quick simulation.\nThe two_arm_designer function in the DesignLibrary package generates designs for a basic two-arm trial in which, by default, half the units are assigned to treatment and the remainder to control. (See ?two_arm_designer for more details.) We’ll use this function to make a sequence of designs. We’ll vary the true value of the estimand, the average treatment effect (ate), from 0 to 1 and we’ll consider two sample sizes, N = 20 and N = 200.\n\nlibrary(DesignLibrary)\ndesigns     &lt;- expand_design(two_arm_designer, \n                             ate = seq(0, 1, 0.1), N = c(20, 200))\nsimulations &lt;- simulate_design(designs)\n\nThe data.frame simulations records results from running these designs many times—equivalent here to implementing many independent studies from a large population of possible studies. The figure shows a scatterplot of the estimand versus the estimate for each run of the study. We facet by whether we condition on significance, nonsignificance, or nothing at all.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'N'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots of estimates against estimands (ranging between 0 and 1) for N = 20 and N = 200. Thick lines show mean values. If vertical and horizontal thick lines cross on the 45 degree line then estimates correspond to estimands on average.\n\n\n\n\nLooking first at the Journal of Significant Results, we see the familiar problem: the average estimate is biased away from the true value of the estimand. This problem is greatly helped by increasing the sample size. But we can also see the second problem – the distribution of estimands (the true effects under study) is also biased towards larger effects, this problem is also allayed, though less dramatically, by larger sample sizes.\nThe Journal of Null Results suffers from a parallel problem, only in reverse. Now estimands are smaller than is typical in the population and, on average, estimates are biased down relative to these estimands. Strikingly, the bias in estimand selection is worse at the larger sample size (though downwards bias within the set of published studies is smaller).\nNow, we agree that proactively publishing null results may help when considering entire research literatures as a whole, and for this reason alone a Journal of Null Results is probably a good thing.\nBut, better would be to not do any conditioning at all. The Journal of Interesting Designs would condition only on the question being interesting and the design being appropriate to answering the question. We see that the distribution of estimates and estimands are both centered on the correct average value. \n\n\nCode to produce figure\nFor those who are interested, here is the code to produce the above figure.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlevels &lt;- c(\"Estimate is significant \\n (Journal of Significant Results)\", \n            \"Estimate is not significant \\n (Journal of Null Results)\", \n            \"No significance filter \\n (Journal of Interesting Designs)\")\n\nsims_1 &lt;- simulations %&gt;% mutate(filter = if_else(p.value &lt; 0.05, levels[1], levels[2]))\n\nsims_2 &lt;- simulations %&gt;% mutate(filter = levels[3])\n\ngg_df &lt;- bind_rows(sims_1, sims_2) %&gt;%\n  mutate(N = paste0(\"N = \", N), filter = factor(filter, levels = levels))\n\nsummary_df &lt;- gg_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(N, filter) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_estimand = mean(estimand),\n            mean_estimate = mean(estimate))\n\nggplot(gg_df, aes(x = estimand, y = estimate, color = filter)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_vline(data = summary_df, aes(xintercept = mean_estimand), size = 1.2, alpha = 1, color = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_hline(data = summary_df, aes(yintercept = mean_estimate), size = 1.2, alpha = 1, color = \"darkgrey\") +\n  scale_colour_brewer(type = \"qual\") +\n  geom_abline() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5) +\n  facet_grid(N ~ filter) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.5, 1.5), ylim = c(-0.5, 1.5)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        strip.background = element_blank()) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank())"

    "text": "An obvious requirement of a good research design is that the question it seeks to answer does in fact have an answer, at least under plausible models of the world. But we can sometimes get quite far along a research path without being conscious that the questions we ask do not have answers and the answers we get are answering different questions.\nHow could a question not have an answer? These situations can arise when inquiries depend on variables that do not exist or are undefined for some units. In this post, we’ll look at one way a question might not have an answer, but there are others.\nConsider an audit experiment that seeks to assess the effects of an email from a person indicating that they are a Democrat (versus not revealing their party identification) on whether and how well election officials respond to requests for information. Whether or not a response is sent is easily observed and measured. The quality of the response is harder to measure, though some aspects, like the tone of the response, can be measured by human coders or possibly computers if fed enough training data.\nMore difficult than the measurement problem, though, is the problem of the “tone” of responses never sent. Simply dropping such observations is no good, because of the possibility that some officials would have responded in one condition but not in the other. After all, a main purpose of audit experiments is to measure the average effect of treatment on response rates, which requires believing that at least some officials would respond in one condition but not another.\nFor that kind of subject (so called if-treated or if-untreated responders), the effect of treatment on the tone of their email is undefined. It doesn’t exist. The question, “what is the effect of treatment on tone” has no answer if, in either the treatment or control condition, the subject wouldn’t respond. That question is only well-defined for subjects who always respond, regardless of treatment.\nTo summarize:"

The good news is that there’s an even simpler and more intuitive approach that gets it right: estimate the difference-in-means within each group, then average over these group-level estimates weighting according to the size of the group.

The first five variables were created by U(): block indicates the block to which the unit belongs, prob indicates the probability of assignment to treatment, tau indicates the block-level treatment effect, indiv indicates the individual ID, and e is the error term. The function Y() appends the potential outcomes, Y_Z_0 and Y_Z_1, by taking e and adding tau in treatment. The function Z() appends two variables: Z is a vector of treatment assignments, block-randomized as a function of the block probabilities, while Z_cond_prob indicates the probability that a given unit is observed in the condition to which they were actually assigned. R() reveals the potential outcomes corresponding to the assignment.↩︎"

As noted in Imai et al. (2009), however, if clusters are of uneven sizes, standard estimation approaches can be biased, even though it’s a randomized experiment. They propose blocking on cluster size in order to address this problem. We’ll use blockTools (by Ryan T. Moore and Keith Schnakenberg) to block on both school and classroom size within schools.\nThe block function within blockTools forms blocks as a function of size by pairing similarly-sized classrooms (blocks of size 2 is the default for the block function, though this can be changed). By telling the function that classes are grouped within schools, we can ensure that blockTools will pair classrooms within the same school. We turn this functionality into a design step like this:\n\n# A step to generate blocks\nblock_function &lt;- function(data) {\n    out &lt;- block(data, id.vars = \"class\", groups = \"school\", block.vars = \"size\")\n    mutate(data, block_id = createBlockIDs(out, data, id.var = \"class\"))}\n\nmake_blocks &lt;- declare_step(handler =  block_function)\n\nLet’s make a design that includes this step and now uses block_id instead of class for blocking:\n\ndesign &lt;- make_data + make_blocks + declare_assignment(Z = block_ra(blocks = block_id))\n\nWhen we draw data we now get the block variables and the assignment probabilities included.

    "text": "Cluster-robust standard errors are known to behave badly with too few clusters. There is a great discussion of this issue by Berk Özler “Beware of studies with a small number of clusters” drawing on studies by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008). See also this nice post by Cyrus Samii and a recent treatment by Esarey and Menger (2018). A rule of thumb is to start worrying about sandwich estimators when the number of clusters goes below 40. But here we show that diagnosis of a canonical design suggests that some sandwich approaches fare quite well even with fewer than 10 clusters.\nWe’ll explore this question by looking at a range of cluster randomized trials. We do this by generating a base design which includes the number of clusters and the number of units per cluster as arguments and then using that design to make a sequence of designs that vary these arguments. In this design we draw separate errors at the individual and cluster levels so that outcomes are correlated within the clusters. Specifically, we assume a fairly large “intracluster correlation coefficient” (ICC) of 0.5. The design employs a range of different approaches for estimating standard errors from the estimatr package, alongside a naive approach that ignores the clusters entirely.1\nHere’s the basic design:\nN_clusters &lt;- 4\ncluster_size &lt;- 5\n\ncluster_design &lt;- \n  \n    declare_model(\n      clusters = add_level(N = N_clusters,   u_c = rnorm(N, sd = .707)),\n      units    = add_level(\n        N = cluster_size, \n        u_i = rnorm(N, sd = .707),\n        potential_outcomes(Y ~ u_i + u_c))\n    ) +\n      \n    declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) +\n      \n    # cluster assignment\n    declare_assignment(Z = cluster_ra(clusters = clusters)) +\n      \n    declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n      \n    # analysis, with different approaches to clustering\n    declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust,  \n                        inquiry = \"ATE\", label = \"1: Naive\") + \n\n    declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, clusters = clusters, \n                        se_type = \"stata\", inquiry = \"ATE\", label = \"2: stata\") +\n      \n    declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, clusters = clusters, \n                        se_type = \"CR0\", inquiry = \"ATE\", label = \"3: CR0\") +\n\n    declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, clusters = clusters, \n                        se_type = \"CR2\", inquiry = \"ATE\", label = \"4: CR2\")\nWe use the redesign function to make a sequence of related designs based on the base design.2 We’re especially interested in what happens at small numbers of clusters, since that’s where the trouble lies, so we will focus the sequence on the low end.\ncluster_designs &lt;- redesign(cluster_design,\n                            N_clusters = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30), \n                            cluster_size = c(3, 30))\nWe diagnose all of these in one go:\ndiagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(cluster_designs, sims = sims)\nLet’s now graph the output separately for the expected standard error, power, and coverage."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We often think of an instrumental variable (\\(Z\\)) as a random shock that generates exogenous variation in a treatment of interest \\(X\\). The randomness of \\(Z\\) lets us identify the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), at least for units for which \\(Z\\) perturbs \\(X\\) in a way that’s not possible by just looking at the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). But surprisingly, we think, if effects are constant the instrumental variables estimator can be consistent for the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) even when the relationship between the instrument (\\(Z\\)) and the endogenous variable (\\(X\\)) is confounded (for example, Hernán and Robins 2006). That’s the good news. Less good news is that when there is effect heterogeneity you can get good estimates for some units but it can be hard to know which units those are (Swanson and Hernán 2017). We use a declaration and diagnosis to illustrate these insights.\nConsider the causal graph below (a directed acyclic graph, or DAG). Here \\(U_2\\) confounds the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). That’s the usual thing and the reason for why you need something like an instrument in the first place. But now a binary \\(U_1\\) also confounds the relationship between \\(Z\\) and \\(X\\) (see for instance Fig 2d Swanson et al. (2018)). To emphasize, in this set up, the instrumental variable and the instrumented variable share a common cause in \\(U_1\\).\nDAG for a non-randomized instrument. Z is an instrument for the effect of X on Y\nUsing DeclareDesign, we write down a declaration that is consistent with this DAG. Our declaration specifies some “compliance types” or “principal strata.” In the standard IV setup with a binary instrument \\(Z\\) and a binary treatment \\(X\\), there are only four types (corresponding to all conceivable ways that the endogenous variable can respond to the exogenous variable): compliers, never-takers, always-takers, and defiers.1 But here, the binary \\(U_1\\) and binary \\(Z\\) both affect \\(X\\), so there are actually sixteen conceivable ways to comply!2\nWe simplify by imagining a world with only three types: \\(U_1\\)-compliers, \\(Z\\)-compliers, and never-takers.3 \\(U_1\\)-compliers have \\(X = 1\\) if and only if \\(U_1 = 1\\). \\(Z\\)-compliers have \\(X = 1\\) if and only if \\(Z = 1\\). Never-takers have \\(X = 0\\) regardless of the values of \\(U_1\\) or \\(Z\\). \\(U_2\\) takes three values, 1-3, and plays two roles.

A more substantively satisfying approach is to try to study spillovers directly. If we do it right we can remove errors in our estimation of primary quantities of interest and learn about how spillovers work at the same time.\nThis is important because spillovers are part of the overall effects of an intervention. If vaccination of one subject improves health outcomes for another, then this gain needs to be understood to assess the total benefits of vaccination. This is hard because we are not used to thinking of spillover effects as estimands, or to writing them in terms of potential outcomes, and so we generally do not think in terms of bias or power for spillover effects.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We sometimes worry about whether we need to model data generating processes correctly. For example you have ordinal outcome variables, on a five-point Likert scale. How should you model the data generation process? Do you need to model it at all? Go-to approaches include ordered probit and ordered logit models which are designed for this kind of outcome variable. But maybe you don’t need them. After all, the argument that the difference-in-means procedure estimates the treatment effect doesn’t depend on any assumptions about the type of data (as long as expectations are defined)—ordered, count, censored, etc. We diagnose a design that hedges by using both differences in means and an ordered probit model. We do so assuming that the ordered probit model correctly describes data generation. Which does better?\nFor the design declaration we assume that the estimand of interest is the average treatment effect on the scale of the data. We do this, perhaps contentiously, even though our outcome is defined on a 1 to 5 ordinal scale. The estimand can be thought of as the average number of steps up or down induced by treatment. This estimand has to be interpreted cautiously, however. In particular it presupposes an interest in outcomes in terms of “steps.” But the “size” of steps depends on the categories provided. Adding in an extra option in the middle of a scale, for example, changes the range of the scale and changes the value of the estimand. Given these issues, other estimands are possible and perhaps preferable (Volfovsky, Airoldi, and Rubin 2015), but for this design, we’ll focus on the ATE.\nSurprisingly, perhaps, we find no real difference between the model-based ordinal logit approach and the differences in means approach. The ordered probit is much more complicated to implement and to draw inferences from: the model is estimated using maximum likelihood, simulation is then used to generate a distribution of fitted values, from which a simulation of the distribution of treatment effects is produced. The standard deviation of these differences is used as an estimate of the standard deviation of treatment effects. The Zelig package (Choirat et al. 2018) makes it easy to do all this quite compactly and turn it all into a step in our design.\nWe call the zelig library, set some parameters, and define a function to take data in and return results.\nlibrary(Zelig)\nlibrary(ZeligChoice)\n\n# This helper function implements an ordered probit model using zelig; calculates \n# quantities of interest and return tidy output\n\nordered_probit &lt;-\n  \n  function(data) {\n    zelig_out &lt;- zelig(Y ~ Z, model = \"oprobit\", data = data, cite = FALSE)\n    \n    sim_out &lt;- sim(zelig_out, x = setx(zelig_out, Z = 0), x1 = setx(zelig_out, Z = 1))\n    \n    zelig_df &lt;- zelig_qi_to_df(sim_out)\n    \n    predictions &lt;- with(zelig_df,\n                        (X1 + 2 * X2 + 3 * X3 + 4 * X4 + 5 * X5)[Z == 1] -\n                        (X1 + 2 * X2 + 3 * X3 + 4 * X4 + 5 * X5)[Z == 0])\n    \n    return_dat &lt;-\n      data.frame(term = \"Z\",\n                 estimate = mean(predictions),\n                 std.error = sd(predictions),\n                 conf.low = quantile(predictions, .025),\n                 conf.high = quantile(predictions, .975))\n    }\nWe can now declare the design:\nordered_probit_design &lt;- \n  \n  declare_model(\n    N = 200, \n    noise = rnorm(N),\n    potential_outcomes(Y ~ draw_ordered(1 * Z + noise, breaks = c(0, 0.75, 1, 1.25)))\n  ) + \n      \n  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N)) +\n  \n  declare_inquiry(ate = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) +\n  \n  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n  \n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, inquiry = \"ate\", label = \"DIM\") +\n  \n  declare_estimator(handler = label_estimator(ordered_probit), inquiry = \"ate\", label = \"Ordered Probit\")\nSample treatment/outcome data look like this:\nDiagnosis goes like this:\ndiagnose_design(ordered_probit_design)\nEstimator\nTerm\nN Sims\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\n\n\n\n\nDIM\nZ\n1000\n-0.00\n0.18\n1.00\n0.97\n1.35\n0.20\n0.20\n0.00\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n\n\nOrdered Probit\nZ\n1000\n-0.03\n0.18\nNA\n0.93\n1.33\n0.19\n0.18\nNA\n1.35\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\nNA\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\nNA\n(0.00)\nNext, we show a histogram of the difference-in-means and ordered probit estimates of the average treatment effect.\nStrikingly, difference-in-means and inferences using an ordered probit model perform very similarly.1 We often reach for ordered models to accomodate the fact that the outcome variable is ordinal and not cardinal, but if your goal is to estimate the average shift in outcomes in terms of shifts in points on the outcome variable you might be making more assumptions than you need.\nTo be clear, the point is not that there is no need to model the data properly. Modelling data generating processes lets you answer questions that difference-in-means does not. For example, assuming the model is correct, you get an estimate for treatment effects on a latent variable. Or you can ask how a treatment affects the probability of moving from a “3” to a “4” on this scale. So there may well be good reasons to use tailored models to model elaborate data generating processes, and buying the assumptions they require. But estimating average treatment effects doesn’t appear to be one of them."

The hypothesis is not that \\(X\\) is the only cause of \\(Y\\), but more simply whether \\(Y\\) would have been different had \\(X\\) been different.

We will also specify a model in which civil war is governed by causal pathway 1 (\\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)) in roughly 20% of countries, by pathway 2 (\\(\\neg X\\) causes \\(Y\\)) in only 10% of countries, by pathway 3 (\\(Y\\) irrespective of \\(X\\)) in 20% of countries, and by pathway 4 (\\(\\neg Y\\) irrespective of \\(X\\)) in half of all countries (that’s not so easy to specify and of course is information that is not available at the answer stage).\nIn addition, we imagine that there is further “process” data that is informative about causal relations. We imagine two types (see Collier (2011) for a discussion of clues of this type):\n\nA straw-in-the-wind clue. A straw-in-the-wind clue is an outcome that is somewhat more likely to be present if the hypothesized causal process is in operation and somewhat less likely if it is not. Let’s say, for example, that \\(E_1\\) is the national army taking control over natural resources during a civil war. We imagine that that’s likely to happen if the natural resources caused the war: \\(Pr(E_1 \\mid H) = .75\\). But even if the natural resources didn’t cause the war, the national army might still take over natural resources for other reasons, say \\(Pr(E_1 \\mid \\neg H) = .25\\).\nA smoking gun clue. A smoking gun clue is an outcome that is somewhat likely to be present if the stipulated hypothesis is true, but very unlikely if it is false. Say one of the antagonists was an armed group whose main name, aims, and ideology were centered around the capture and control of natural resources. This information provides a clue which might be really unlikely to arise in general, even if \\(H\\) is true. But it’s very informative if it is observed, since it’s so unlikely to arise if \\(H\\) is not true: it’s a “smoking gun.” Let’s say \\(Pr(E_2 \\mid H) = .3, Pr(E_2 \\mid \\neg H) = 0.05\\).\n\nThese clues might themselves be mediators, or moderators, or even arise post treatment, though we do not specify the full causal model that gives rise to them here. Rather, we simply define a step that generates these clue observations independently, conditional on the causal process. This is a strong assumption: the fact that an armed group formed in order to take resources (\\(E_2\\)) might convince the government to take over the natural resource (\\(E_1\\)) – or it might dissuade the government! We therefore relax this “Independent Clues” assumption below.\nThis gives us enough information to put down the stub of a design in which a model generates data with these features, an imaginary researcher samples one case from the \\(X=Y=1\\) group, and defines the question the researcher wants to ask about this case.

    "text": "You can often improve the precision of your randomized controlled trial with blocking: first gather similar units together into groups, then run experiments inside each little group, then average results across experiments. Block random assignment (sometimes called stratified random assignment) can be great—increasing precision with blocking is like getting extra sample size for free. Blocking works because it’s like controlling for a pre-treatment covariate in the “Data Strategy” rather than in the “Answer Strategy.” But sometimes it does more harm than good.\nThe standard experimental guidance is to block if you can in order to improve precision. (If for some reason you don’t have access to the pre-treatment covariates before the experiment is conducted, don’t fret, as the precision gains you would get from blocking on the front end can largely be made up by controlling on the back end.) In fact, even if you make blocks at random, you do as well as you would do under complete random assignment. For a textbook explanation of the benefits of blocking, see Gerber and Green (2012) (Section 3.6.1).\nBut is it possible to make things worse? Can you make a blocking that results in less precision than you would get from complete random assignment design?\nThe answer is yes. But you have to try really hard. If you organize units into groups that are internally unusually heterogeneous you can make things worse. For a formal analysis, see Imai (2008)."

Which is better?\nFor a discussion see this post by Andrew Gelman and follow up comments by Winston Lin (that led us to the Allison reference we use below) and by Jens Hainmueller (that describes this logic).\nIn this post, design diagnosis shows that which approach is best depends on how outcomes are generated in the first place. A differencing approach might sometimes be effective at removing confounding bias but might do so at a cost of greater variance.

    "text": "A dangerous fact: it is quite possible to talk in a seemingly coherent way about strategies to answer a research question without ever properly specifying what the research question is. The risk is that you end up with the right solution to the wrong problem. The problem is particularly acute for studies where there are risks of “spillovers.”\nBy spillovers we mean situations where one unit’s outcome depends upon how another unit is assigned to treatment. You often hear worries that estimates of average treatment effects are biased in the presence of such spillovers. And in particular that when there are positive spillovers, estimates will be biased downwards. Sensible as these worries sound, try to state them formally and you can run into some difficulties. The key issue is that the assumption of no spillovers runs so deep that it is often invoked even prior to the definition of estimands. If you write the “average treatment effect” estimand using potential outcomes notation, as \\(E(Y(1) - Y(0))\\), you are already assuming that a unit’s outcomes depend only on its own assignment to treatment and not on how other units are assigned to treatment. The definition of the estimand leaves no space to even describe spillovers.\nIf there are in fact spillovers, then the estimand needs to be spelled out more carefully. In this case, the range of estimands to choose may be very wide and the appropriateness of different strategies is going to depend on which estimand you are shooting for.\nThis post shows how:\nAlong the way, we show how to modify designs by switching up steps at different points."

    "text": "Estimands given spillovers\nThere are many different estimands that can take account of spillover effects, if there are any, but that correspond to the usual average treatment effects estimand when there are no spillovers. For instance, we can define the difference for a unit when it—and only it—is treated, compared to a situation in which no unit is treated. In potential outcomes notation that could be written, for unit 3, say, as:\n\\[\\tau_3 = Y(0,0,1,0,0,\\dots) -  Y(0,0,0,0,0,\\dots)\\]\nOne could then define a population estimand that is the average of all these differences over a population. Note that these differences specify different counterfactual assignment vectors for each individual. In the absence of spillovers, this estimand is equivalent to the usual average treatment effect. In the presence of spillovers, this estimand is well defined, whereas the usual average treatment effect estimand is not.\nThere are many other possibilities. For example, the difference in outcomes when no units are treated and all units are treated. Or the difference between not being treated when all others are, and being treated when all others are. Or, the difference a change in your own condition would make given that others are assigned to the value that they actually have (see e.g. Sävje, Aronow, and Hudgens (2017)). In fact, with \\(n\\) units and binary assignments, we can define \\(2^n\\times2^n\\) simple comparisons for each unit.\nBelow, we declare a design that allows for the possibility of spillovers. Diagnosing the design shows how severe the problem of spillovers can be for estimation. Modifying the design lets us explore different types of solutions."

We define a helper function, dgp, which reports an individual’s outcome given the full treatment assignment vector. We then apply that function to each unit separately and take the average.\nThis design produces data that looks like this:\n\ndraw_data(spillover_design)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\nn\ni\nI\nzeros\nones\nZ\nY\n\n\n\n\n01\n3\n001\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1.1426481\n\n\n01\n3\n002\n2\n0\n1\n1\n0.8914236\n\n\n01\n3\n003\n3\n0\n1\n1\n1.1771557\n\n\n02\n3\n004\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0.0413922\n\n\n02\n3\n005\n5\n0\n1\n0\n-0.0904998\n\n\n02\n3\n006\n6\n0\n1\n1\n0.4877476\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can diagnose the design like this:\n\ndiagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(spillover_design)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\n\n\n\n\n0.22\n0.23\n1.00\n0.00\n0.33\n0.05\n0.04\n0.00\n0.11\n\n\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see considerable bias here because the difference-in-means estimator does not account for within-group spillovers. Many units in the control condition are affected by the treatments received by other members of their group.\nInterestingly, in this case, we have an overestimate of the effect, even though there are positive spillovers. In the assumed model, there are increasing returns to spillovers. Units that are treated are also likely to be in groups with a higher proportion of treated units (since, by definition, at least one member of their group is already treated). On average, treated units thus receive more positive spillover than untreated units, leading to exaggerated estimates."

    "text": "Whether a sparser sample helps depends on the estimand of interest\nThere are multiple solutions to this kind of problem. How well they work depends, however, on how well we understand the structure of spillover effects in the first place.\nOne approach is to alter assignment strategies (see, e.g., Bowers et al. (2018)). An even simpler one is to employ a sparser sample. This approach seems to go against one of the few near-universal principles of research design: study as many units as possible.\nBut here there may be some wisdom to it. Although more units generally means greater precision, there may be a cost to this when there are risks of spillovers. If a larger study means treating more units, and this means more units interfere with each other, you might end up with a spuriously precise, biased estimate.\nHere is an alternative design that implements the original data and analysis strategies on a sample of one subject per group:\n\nsparse_design &lt;- insert_step(spillover_design, after = \"Treat_one\",\n                          declare_sampling(S = strata_rs(strata = G, prob = 1/3)))\n\nNote that it is important that the sampling takes place here after the definition of the estimand. Spillovers operate as a function of population characteristics, not just sample characteristics.\nOur narrower sampling strategy reduces the N by two-thirds (from 240 to 80). But the results are now unbiased. Note that we did not change our original assignment strategy, in which units are assigned to treatment or to control with .5 probability. Rather, we changed the sampling strategy. Before, we kept whole groups and assigned no members or several members to treatment. We now select one member per group and assign them to treatment or to control. Because we only select one member per group, and spillovers only go within and not between groups, there is no way for our treatment or control units to receive spillovers.\nHere is a diagnosis of this sparser design:\n\ndiagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(sparse_design, sims = sims)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n0.05\n0.70\n0.93\n0.11\n0.04\n0.04\n0.00\n0.11\n\n\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have an unbiased design. Here though getting an unbiased design depended on having a good understanding of the nature of spillovers. In this case, we made use of the fact there would be no spillovers between groups.\nHowever, how good this solution is also depends on what exactly the estimand is. What if the estimand were the average difference in outcomes between a world in which no unit is treated and one in which all units are treated?\nWe answer this question by declaring a new design that adds in the new estimand and links it to the estimator.\nWe first define the steps:\n\nnew_estimand  &lt;- declare_inquiry(Treat_all = mean(\n                  sapply(I, function(i) dgp(i,ones,G,n) - dgp(i, zeros, G,n))\n                  ))\n\nnew_estimator &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust,\n                                   estimand = list(\"Treat_one\", \"Treat_all\"))\n\nWe then splice the steps in where we want them (estimand before the sampling, estimator after the sampling):\n\nsparse_design &lt;- insert_step(sparse_design, after = \"Treat_one\", new_estimand)\nsparse_design &lt;- replace_step(sparse_design, \"naive\", new_estimator)\n\nThe diagnosis highlights how poorly the sampling solution works for this new estimand:\n\ndiagnose_design(sparse_design)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiry\nBias\nRMSE\nPower\nCoverage\nMean Estimate\nSD Estimate\nMean Se\nType S Rate\nMean Estimand\n\n\n\n\nTreat_all\n-0.89\n0.89\n0.68\n0.00\n0.11\n0.05\n0.04\n0.00\n1.00\n\n\n\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n\n\nTreat_one\n0.00\n0.05\n0.68\n0.93\n0.11\n0.05\n0.04\n0.00\n0.11\n\n\n\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n(0.00)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sparser design fails because the treatment density is insufficient to reveal the potential outcomes required by the estimand: you cannot figure out the effects of saturation if you do not saturate.\nA future post will describe approaches to addressing spillovers that work through estimation strategies, rather than through sampling and assignment strategies.\n\nPost edited to reflect name change to spillover_designer() on 11/12/2018."
